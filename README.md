New Zendesk Tabs
================

Chrome extension for opening Zendesk tickets urls in the same New Zendesk tab.

## What it does

When you click in a url like mydomain.zendesk.com/tickets/1, it opens the ticket in the New Zendesk tab (in a ticket tab within the app) if there is one present. That means that all your tickets will open in the same tab!

Specially useful when clicking in links from your email client.
